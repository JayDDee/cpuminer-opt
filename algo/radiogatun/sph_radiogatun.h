/**
 * RadioGatun interface.
 *
 * RadioGatun has been published in: G. Bertoni, J. Daemen, M. Peeters
 * and G. Van Assche, "RadioGatun, a belt-and-mill hash function",
 * presented at the Second Cryptographic Hash Workshop, Santa Barbara,
 * August 24-25, 2006. The main Web site, containing that article, the
 * reference code and some test vectors, appears to be currently located
 * at the following URL: http://radiogatun.noekeon.org/
 *
 * The presentation article does not specify endianness or padding. The
 * reference code uses the following conventions, which we also apply
 * here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The input message is an integral number of sequences of three
 * words. Each word is either a 32-bit of 64-bit word (depending on
 * the version of RadioGatun).</li>
 * <li>Input bytes are decoded into words using little-endian
 * convention.</li>
 * <li>Padding consists of a single bit of value 1, using little-endian
 * convention within bytes (i.e. for a byte-oriented input, a single
 * byte of value 0x01 is appended), then enough bits of value 0 to finish
 * the current block.</li>
 * <li>Output consists of 256 bits. Successive output words are encoded
 * with little-endian convention.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These conventions are very close to those we use for PANAMA, which is
 * a close ancestor or RadioGatun.
 *
 * RadioGatun is actually a family of functions, depending on some
 * internal parameters. We implement here two functions, with a "belt
 * length" of 13, a "belt width" of 3, and a "mill length" of 19. The
 * RadioGatun[32] version uses 32-bit words, while the RadioGatun[64]
 * variant uses 64-bit words.
 *
 * Strictly speaking, the name "RadioGatun" should use an acute accent
 * on the "u", which we omitted here to keep strict ASCII-compatibility
 * of this file.
