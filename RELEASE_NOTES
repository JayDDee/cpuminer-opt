cpuminer-opt now supports HW SHA acceleration available on AMD Ryzen CPUs.
This feature requires recent SW including GCC version 5 or higher and
openssl version 1.1 or higher. It may also require using "-march=znver1"
compile flag.

HW SHA support is only available when compiled from source, Windows binaries
are not yet available.

cpuminer-opt is a console program, if you're using a mouse you're doing it
wrong.

Security warning
----------------

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are miners. The source
code is open for anyone to inspect. If you don't trust the software, don't use
it.

The cryptographic code has been taken from trusted sources but has been
modified for speed at the expense of accepted security practices. This
code should not be imported into applications where secure cryptography is
required.

Compile Instructions
--------------------

Requirements:

Intel Core2 or newer, or AMD Steamroller or newer CPU. ARM CPUs are not
supported.
64 bit Linux or Windows operating system. Apple is not supported.

Building on linux prerequisites:

It is assumed users know how to install packages on their system and
be able to compile standard source packages. This is basic Linux and
beyond the scope of cpuminer-opt.

Make sure you have the basic development packages installed.
Here is a good start:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/457526/how-to-install-cpuminer-in-ubuntu

Install any additional dependencies needed by cpuminer-opt. The list below
are some of the ones that may not be in the default install and need to
be installed manually. There may be others, read the error messages they
will give a clue as to the missing package.

The following command should install everything you need on Debian based
distributions such as Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libgmp-dev automake


build-essential  (for Ubuntu, Development Tools package group on Fedora)
automake
libjansson-dev
libgmp-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libssl-dev
pthreads
zlib

SHA support on AMD Ryzen CPUs requires gcc version 5 or higher and openssl 1.1
or higher. Reports of improved performiance on Ryzen when using openssl 1.0.2
have been due to AVX and AVX2 optimizations added to that version.
Additional improvements are expected on Ryzen with openssl 1.1.
"-march-znver1" or "-msha".

Additional instructions for static compilalation can be found here:
https://lxadm.com/Static_compilation_of_cpuminer
Static builds should only considered in a homogeneous HW and SW environment.
Local builds will always have the best performance and compatibility.

Extract cpuminer source.

tar xvzf cpuminer-opt-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd cpuminer-opt-x.y.z

Run ./build.sh to build on Linux or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11" ./configure --with-curl
make

Additional optional compile flags, add the following to CFLAGS to activate:

-DUSE_SPH_SHA

SPH may give slightly better performance on algos that use sha256 when using
openssl 1.0.1 or older. Openssl 1.0.2 adds AVX2 and 1.1 adds SHA and perform
better than SPH.

Start mining.

./cpuminer -a algo -o url -u username -p password

Windows

The following in how the Windows binary releases are built. It's old and
not very good but it works, for me anyway.

Building on Windows prerequisites:

msys
mingw_w64
Visual C++ redistributable 2008 X64
openssl

Install msys and mingw_w64, only needed once.

Unpack msys into C:\msys or your preferred directory.

Install mingw_w64 from win-builds.
Follow instructions, check "msys or cygwin" and "x86_64" and accept default
existing msys instalation.

Open a msys shell by double clicking on msys.bat.
Note that msys shell uses linux syntax for file specifications, "C:\" is
mounted at "/c/".

Add mingw bin directory to PATH variable
PATH="/c/msys/opt/windows_64/bin/:$PATH"

Instalation complete, compile cpuminer-opt.

Unpack cpuminer-opt source files using tar from msys shell, or using 7zip
or similar Windows program.

In msys shell cd to miner directory.
cd /c/path/to/cpuminer-opt

Run winbuild.sh to build on Windows or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11 -fpermissive" ./configure --with-curl
make

Start mining

cpuminer.exe -a algo -o url -u user -p password

The following tips may be useful for older AMD CPUs.

AMD CPUs older than Steamroller, including Athlon x2 and Phenom II x4, are
not supported by cpuminer-opt due to an incompatible implementation of SSE2
on these CPUs. Some algos may crash the miner with an invalid instruction.
Users are recommended to use an unoptimized miner such as cpuminer-multi.

Some users with AMD CPUs without AES_NI have reported problems compiling
with build.sh or "-march=native". Problems have included compile errors
and poor performance. These users are recommended to compile manually
specifying "-march=btver1" on the configure command line.

Support for even older x86_64 without AES_NI or SSE2 is not availble.

v3.7.7

Fixed regression caused by 64 CPU support.
Fixed lyra2h.

v3.7.6

Added lyra2h algo for Hppcoin.
Added support for more than 64 CPUs.
Optimized shavite512 with AES, improves x11 etc.

v3.7.5

New algo keccakc for Creative coin with 4way optimizations

Rewrote some AVX/AVX2 code for more consistent implementation and some
optimizing.

Enhanced capabilities check to support 4way, more precise reporting of
features (not all algos use SSE2), and better error messages when using
an incompatible pre-built version (Windows users).

v3.7.4

Removed unnecessary build options.

Added 4way support for tribus and nist5.

v3.7.3

Added polytimos algo.

Introducing 4-way AVX2 optimization giving up to 4x performance inprovement
on many compute bound algos. First supported algos: skein, skein2, blake &
keccak. This feature is only available when compiled from source. See above
for instcuctions how to enable 4-way during compilation.

Updated Dockerfile.

v3.7.2

Fixed yescryptr16
Changed default sha256 and sha512 to openssl. This should be used when
compiling with openssl 1.0.2 or higher (Ubuntu 16.04).
This should increase the hashrate for yescrypt, yescryptr16, m7m, xevan, skein,
myr-gr & others  when openssl 1.0.2 is installed.
Users with openssl 1.0.1 (Ubuntu 14.04) may get better perforance by adding
"-DUSE_SPH_SHA" to CLAGS. 
Windows binaries are compiled with -DUSE_SPH_SHA and won't get the speedup.

Added yescryptr16 algo for Yenten coin
Added SHA support to yescrypt and yescryptr16
Small code cleanup

v3.6.5

Cryptonight a little faster.
Added jha algo (Jackpotcoin) with AES optimizations.

"-a bitcore" works as an alias and is less typing that "-a timetravel10".

v3.6.3

 Windows binaries.

v3.6.2

SHA accceleration is now supported on AMD Ryzen CPUs when compiled from source,
  Windows binaries not yet available.

build.sh and winbuild.sh initialize with distclean instead of clean.
