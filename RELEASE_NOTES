cpuminer-opt is a console program run from the command line using the
keyboard, not the mouse.

cpuminer-opt now supports HW SHA acceleration available on AMD Ryzen CPUs.
This feature requires recent SW including GCC version 5 or higher and
openssl version 1.1 or higher. It may also require using "-march=znver1"
compile flag.

cpuminer-opt is a console program, if you're using a mouse you're doing it
wrong.

Security warning
----------------

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are cryptocurrency 
miners. The source code is open for anyone to inspect. If you don't trust 
the software, don't use it.

The cryptographic hashing code has been taken from trusted sources but has been
modified for speed at the expense of accepted security practices. This
code should not be imported into applications where secure cryptography is
required.

Compile Instructions
--------------------

See INSTALL_LINUX or INSTALL_WINDOWS fror compile instruuctions

Requirements
------------

Intel Core2 or newer, or AMD Steamroller or newer CPU. ARM CPUs are not
supported.

64 bit Linux or Windows operating system. Apple and Android are not supported.

New algos: bmw512, x16rt, x16rt-veil (alias veil), x13bcd (alias bcd).

v3.9.5.4

Fixed sha256q AVX2 poor performance.
Fixed skein2 buffer overflow and restored bswap-interleave optimization.
More restructuring.

v3.9.5.3

Fix crash mining hodl with aes-sse42.
More restructuring and share report tweaks.

v3.9.5.2

Revert bswap-interleave optimization for causing crashes on Windows.

v3.9.5.1

Fixed skein2 crash on Windows.

Fixed CPU temperature reading on Ubuntu 19.04.

Realigned log message colours, blue is used to report normal activity and
yellow is only used to report abnormal activity.

Changed stats colours, yellow now means below average, white is average
range. Tweaked colour thresholds.

Changed colour of stratum difficulty change messages to blue to match other
normal protocol messages. Blue messages (block, stratum, submit) will no
longer be displayed when using -q option.

Added job id to new block, share submit, and share result messages and added
new nessage when a new job is received for an existing block. This will for
better troubleshooting of invalid job id rejects seen at zergpool.

Some more restructuring.

v3.9.5

New share reporting information includes calculation of equivalent hashrate
based on share difficulty, network latency, 5 minute summary.
Per-thread hash rate reports are disabled by default.
New command line option --hash-meter added to enable per-thread hash rates.


v3.9.4

Faster AVX2 for lyra2v3, quark, anime.
Fixed skein AVX2 regression (invalid shares since v3.9.0) and faster.
Faster skein2 with 4way AVX2 enabled.
Automatic SHA override on Ryzen CPUs, no need for -DRYZEN compile flag.
Ongoing restructuring.

v3.9.3.1

Skipped v3.9.3 due to misidentification of v3.9.2.5 as v3.9.3.
Fixed x16r algo 25% invalid share reject rate. The bug may have also
affected other algos.

v3.9.2.5

Fixed 2 regressions: hodl AES detection, x16r invalid shares with AVX2.
More restructuring.

v3.9.2.4

Yet another affinity fix. Hopefully the last one.

v3.9.2.3

Another cpu-affinity fix.
Disabled test code that fails to compile on some CPUs with limited
AVX512 capabilities.

v3.9.2.2

Fixed some day one cpu-affinity issues.

v3.9.2

Added sha256q algo.
Yespower now uses openssl SHA256, but no observable hash rate increase
on Ryzen.
Ongoing rearchitecting.
Lyra2z now hashes 8-way on CPUs with AVX2.
Lyra2 (all including phi2) now runs optimized code with SSE2.

v3.9.1.1

Fixed lyra2v3 AVX and below.

Compiling on Windows using Cygwin now works. Simply use "./build.sh"
just like on Linux. It isn't portable therefore the binaries package will
continue to use the existing procedure.
The Cygwin procedure will be documented in more detail later and will
include a list of packages that need to be installed.

v3.9.1

Fixed AVX2 version of anime algo.

Added sonoa algo.

Added "-DRYZEN_" compile option for Ryzen to override 4-way hashing when algo 
contains sha256 and use SHA instead. This is due to a combination of
the introduction of HW SHA support combined with the poor performance
of AVX2 on Ryzen. The Windows binaries package replaces cpuminer-avx2-sha
with cpuminer-zen compiled with the override. Refer to the build instructions
for more information.

Ongoing restructuring to streamline the process, reduce latency,
reduce memory usage and unnecessary copying of data. Most of these
will not result in a notoceably higher reported hashrate as the
change simply reduces the time wasted that wasn't factored into the
hash rate reported by the miner. In short, less dead time resulting in
a higher net hashrate.

One of these measures to reduce latency also results in an enhanced
share submission message including the share number*, the CPU thread,
and the vector lane that found the solution. The time difference between
the share submission and acceptance (or rejection) response indicates
network ltatency. One other effect of this change is a reduction in hash
meter messages because the scan function no longer exits when a share is 
found. Scan cycles will go longer and submit multiple shares per cycle.
*the share number is antcipated and includes both accepted and rejected
shares. Because the share is antipated and not synchronized it may be
incorrect in time of very rapid share submission. Under most conditions
it should be easy to match the submission with the corresponding response.

Removed "-DUSE_SPH_SHA" option, all users should have a recent version of
openssl installed: v1.0.2 (Ubuntu 16.04) or better. Ryzen SHA requires
v1.1.0 or better. Ryzen SHA is not used when hashing multi-way parallel.
Ryzen SHA is available in the Windows binaries release package.

Improved compile instructions, now in seperate files: INSTALL_LINUX and
INSTALL_WINDOWS. The Windows instructions are used to build the binaries
release package. It's built on a Linux system either running as a virtual
machine or a seperate computer. At this time there is no known way to
build natively on a Windows system.
