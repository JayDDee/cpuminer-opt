cpuminer-opt now supports HW SHA acceleration available on AMD Ryzen CPUs.
This feature requires recent SW including GCC version 5 or higher and
openssl version 1.1 or higher. It may also require using "-march=znver1"
compile flag.

HW SHA support is only available when compiled from source, Windows binaries
are not yet available.

cpuminer-opt is a console program, if you're using a mouse you're doing it
wrong.

Compile Instructions
--------------------

Requirements:

Intel Core2 or newer, or AMD Steamroller or newer CPU.
64 bit Linux or Windows operating system.

Building on linux prerequisites:

It is assumed users know how to install packages on their system and
be able to compile standard source packages. This is basic Linux and
beyond the scope of cpuminer-opt.

Make sure you have the basic development packages installed.
Here is a good start:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/457526/how-to-install-cpuminer-in-ubuntu

Install any additional dependencies needed by cpuminer-opt. The list below
are some of the ones that may not be in the default install and need to
be installed manually. There may be others, read the error messages they
will give a clue as to the missing package.

The following command should install everything you need on Debian based
distributions such as Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libgmp-dev automake


build-essential  (for Ubuntu, Development Tools package group on Fedora)
automake
libjansson-dev
libgmp-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libssl-dev
pthreads
zlib

SHA support on AMD Ryzen CPUs requires gcc version 5 or higher and openssl 1.1
or higher. Additional compile options may also be required such as
"-march-znver1" or "-msha".

Extract cpuminer source.

tar xvzf cpuminer-opt-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd cpuminer-opt-x.y.z

Run ./build.sh to build on Linux or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11" ./configure --with-curl
make

Start mining.

./cpuminer -a algo -o url -u username -p password

Building on Windows prerequisites:

msys
mingw_w64
Visual C++ redistributable 2008 X64
openssl

Install msys and mingw_w64, only needed once.

Unpack msys into C:\msys or your preferred directory.

Install mingw_w64 from win-builds.
Follow instructions, check "msys or cygwin" and "x86_64" and accept default
existing msys instalation.

Open a msys shell by double clicking on msys.bat.
Note that msys shell uses linux syntax for file specifications, "C:\" is
mounted at "/c/".

Add mingw bin directory to PATH variable
PATH="/c/msys/opt/windows_64/bin/:$PATH"

Instalation complete, compile cpuminer-opt.

Unpack cpuminer-opt source files using tar from msys shell, or using 7zip
or similar Windows program.

In msys shell cd to miner directory.
cd /c/path/to/cpuminer-opt

Run winbuild.sh to build on Windows or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11 -fpermissive" ./configure --with-curl
make

The following tips may be useful for older AMD CPUs.

AMD CPUs older than Piledriver, including Athlon x2 and Phenom II x4, are not
supported by cpuminer-opt due to an incompatible implementation of SSE2 on
these CPUs. Some algos may crash the miner with an invalid instruction.
Users are recommended to use an unoptimized miner such as cpuminer-multi.

Some users with AMD CPUs without AES_NI have reported problems compiling
with build.sh or "-march=native". Problems have included compile errors
and poor performance. These users are recommended to compile manually
specifying "-march=btver1" on the configure command line.

Support for even older x86_64 without AES_NI or SSE2 is not availble.


Change Log
----------

v3.6.5

Cryptonight a little faster.
Added jha algo (Jackpotcoin) with AES optimizations.

v3.6.4

Added support for Bitcore (BTX) using the timetravel10 algo, optimized for
AES and AVX2. 
"-a bitcore" works as an alias and is less typing that "-a timetravel10".

v3.6.3

Fixed all known issues with SHA support on AMD Ryzen CPUs, still no
 Windows binaries.

v3.6.2

SHA accceleration is now supported on AMD Ryzen CPUs when compiled from source,
  Windows binaries not yet available.
Fixed groestl algo.
Fixed dmd-gr (Diamond) algo.
Fixed lbry compile error on Ryzen.
Added SHA support to m7m algo.
Hodl support for CPUs without AES has been removed, use legacy version.

v3.6.1

Fixed data alignment issue that broke lyra2rev2 AVX2 on Windows.
Added preliminary support for HW accelerated SHA.
Solo mining most algos should now work, cryptonight confirmed exception.

v3.6.0

Preliminary support for solo mining using getwork.

v3.5.13

Found more speed in Cubehash, algo improvement depends on chain length,
  deep +8%, timetravel +1% , xevan +1%
Fixed a getwork bug, solo mining is not yet supported but testing is encouraged

v3.5.12

New algo sha256t for Onecoin (OC), 29% faster than ocminer version.
