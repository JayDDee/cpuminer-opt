Security warning
----------------

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
usually a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are
cryptocurrency miners. However, some malware masquerading as a miner has
been spread using the cover that miners are known to be subject to false
positives ans users will dismiss the AV alert. Always be on alert.
The source code of cpuminer-opt is open for anyone to inspect.
If you don't trust the software don't download it.

The cryptographic hashing code has been taken from trusted sources but has been
modified for speed at the expense of accepted security practices. This
code should not be imported into applications where secure cryptography is
required.

Compile Instructions
--------------------

See INSTALL_LINUX or INSTALL_WINDOWS for compile instruuctions

Requirements
------------

Intel Core2 or newer, or AMD Steamroller or newer CPU. ARM CPUs are not
supported.

64 bit Linux or Windows operating system. Apple, Android and Raspberry Pi
are not supported. FreeBSD YMMV.

Change Log
----------

v3.18.1

More speed for scrypt:
 - additional scryptn2 optimizations for all CPU architectures,
 - AVX2 is now used by default on CPUS with SHA but not AVX512,
 - scrypt:1024 performance lost in v3.18.0 is restored,
 - AVX512 & AVX2 improvements to scrypt:1024.

Big speedup for SwiFFTx AVX2 & SSE4.1: x22i +55%, x25x +22%.

Issue #337: fixed a problem that could display negative stats values in the
first summary report if the report was forced prematurely due to a stratum
diff change. The stats will still be invalid but should display zeros.

v3.18.0

Complete rewrite of Scrypt code, optimized for large N factor (scryptn2):
  - AVX512 & SHA support for sha256, AVX512 has priority,
  - up to 50% increase in hashrate,
  - memory requirements reduced 30-60% depending on CPU architecture,
  - memory usage displayed at startup,
  - scrypt, default N=1024 (LTC), will likely perform slower.

Improved stale share detection and handling for Scrypt with large N factor:
  - abort and discard partially computed hash when new work is detected,
  - quicker response to new job, less time wasted mining stale job.

Improved stale share handling for all algorithms:
  - report possible stale share when new work received with a previously
    submitted share still pending,
  - when new work is detected report the submission of an already completed,
    otherwise valid, but likely stale, share,
  - fixed incorrect block height in stale share log.

Small performance improvements to sha, bmw, cube & hamsi for AVX512 & AVX2.

When stratum disconnects miner threads go to idle until reconnected.

Colour changes to some logs.

Some low level function name changes for clarity and consistency.

are now the mean hashrate for the session.

API can now be enabled with "-b port" or "--api-bind port".
It will use the default address 127.0.0.1.

Removed phi2-lux alias (introduced in v3.9.8) due to Luxcoin's planned fork
to a new algo. The new Luxcoin algo is not supported by cpuminer-opt.
Until the fork Luxcoin can be mined using phi2 algo.

--hide-diff option is deprecated and has no effect. It will be removed in a

-R, --param-r: set the R parameter for yescrypt or yespower algos, scrypt is
     hardcoded with R=1
-K, --param-key: set the client key/pers parameter for yescrypt/yespower algos.

These options can be used to mine yescrypt or yespower variations using
the generic yescrypt or yespower algo name and specifying the parameters
manually. They can even be used to mine variations that aren't formally
supported by a unique algo name. Existing algos can continue to to be mined
using their original name without parameters.

New algo blake2b.
Faster myr-gr on Ryzen using SHA.

yellow is only used to report abnormal activity.

Changed stats colours, yellow now means below average, white is average
range. Tweaked colour thresholds.

Changed colour of stratum difficulty change messages to blue to match other
normal protocol messages. Blue messages (block, stratum, submit) will no
longer be displayed when using -q option.

Added job id to new block, share submit, and share result messages and added
new nessage when a new job is received for an existing block. This will for
better troubleshooting of invalid job id rejects seen at zergpool.

Some more restructuring.

v3.9.5

New share reporting information includes calculation of equivalent hashrate
based on share difficulty, network latency, 5 minute summary.

Faster skein2 with 4way AVX2 enabled.

Ongoing restructuring.

v3.9.3.1

Skipped v3.9.3 due to misidentification of v3.9.2.5 as v3.9.3.

on Ryzen.
Ongoing rearchitecting.
Lyra2z now hashes 8-way on CPUs with AVX2.
Lyra2 (all including phi2) now runs optimized code with SSE2.

v3.9.1.1

Fixed lyra2v3 AVX and below.

Compiling on Windows using Cygwin now works. Simply use "./build.sh"
just like on Linux. It isn't portable therefore the binaries package will
continue to use the existing procedure.
The Cygwin procedure will be documented in more detail later and will
include a list of packages that need to be installed.

v3.9.1

Fixed AVX2 version of anime algo.

Added sonoa algo.

Added "-DRYZEN_" compile option for Ryzen to override 4-way hashing when algo 
contains sha256 and use SHA instead. This is due to a combination of
the introduction of HW SHA support combined with the poor performance
of AVX2 on Ryzen. The Windows binaries package replaces cpuminer-avx2-sha
with cpuminer-zen compiled with the override. Refer to the build instructions
for more information.

Ongoing restructuring to streamline the process, reduce latency,
reduce memory usage and unnecessary copying of data. Most of these
will not result in a notoceably higher reported hashrate as the
change simply reduces the time wasted that wasn't factored into the
hash rate reported by the miner. In short, less dead time resulting in
a higher net hashrate.

One of these measures to reduce latency also results in an enhanced
share submission message including the share number*, the CPU thread,
and the vector lane that found the solution. The time difference between
the share submission and acceptance (or rejection) response indicates
network ltatency. One other effect of this change is a reduction in hash
meter messages because the scan function no longer exits when a share is 
found. Scan cycles will go longer and submit multiple shares per cycle.
*the share number is antcipated and includes both accepted and rejected
shares. Because the share is antipated and not synchronized it may be
incorrect in time of very rapid share submission. Under most conditions
it should be easy to match the submission with the corresponding response.

Removed "-DUSE_SPH_SHA" option, all users should have a recent version of
openssl installed: v1.0.2 (Ubuntu 16.04) or better. Ryzen SHA requires
v1.1.0 or better. Ryzen SHA is not used when hashing multi-way parallel.
Ryzen SHA is available in the Windows binaries release package.

Improved compile instructions, now in seperate files: INSTALL_LINUX and
INSTALL_WINDOWS. The Windows instructions are used to build the binaries
release package. It's built on a Linux system either running as a virtual
machine or a seperate computer. At this time there is no known way to
build natively on a Windows system.

build.sh and winbuild.sh initialize with distclean instead of clean.
