cpuminer-opt is a fork of cpuminer-multi by TPruvot with optimizations
imported from other miners developped by lucas Jones, djm34, Wolf0, pooler,
Jeff garzik, ig0tik3d, elmad, palmd, and Optiminer, with additional
optimizations by Jay D Dee.

All of the code is believed to be open and free. If anyone has a
claim to any of it post your case in the cpuminer-opt Bitcoin Talk forum
or by email.

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are cryptocurrency 
miners. The source code is open for anyone to inspect. If you don't trust 
the software, don't use it.

This note is to confirm that bitcointalk users JayDDee and joblo are the
same person.

I created a new BCT user JayDDee to match my github user id.
The old thread has been locked but still contains useful information for
reading.

See file RELEASE_NOTES for change log and INSTALL_LINUX or INSTALL_WINDOWS
for compile instructions.

Requirements
------------

1. A x86_64 architecture CPU with a minimum of SSE2 support. This includes
Intel Core2 and newer and AMD equivalents. Further optimizations are available
on some algoritms for CPUs with AES, AVX, AVX2, SHA, AVX512 and VAES.

Older CPUs are supported by cpuminer-multi by TPruvot but at reduced
performance.

ARM and Aarch64 CPUs are not supported.

2. 64 bit Linux or Windows OS. Ubuntu and Fedora based distributions,
including Mint and Centos, are known to work and have all dependencies
in their repositories. Others may work but may require more effort. Older
versions such as Centos 6 don't work due to missing features. 
64 bit Windows OS is supported with mingw_w64 and msys or pre-built binaries.

MacOS, OSx and Android are not supported.

3. Stratum pool supporting stratum+tcp:// or stratum+ssl:// protocols or
RPC getwork using http:// or https://.
GBT is YMMV.

Errata
------

Old algorithms that are no longer used frequently will not have the latest
optimizations.

Cryptonight and variants are no longer supported, use another miner.

Neoscrypt crashes on Windows, use legacy version.

AMD CPUs older than Piledriver, including Athlon x2 and Phenom II x4, are not
supported by cpuminer-opt due to an incompatible implementation of SSE2 on
these CPUs. Some algos may crash the miner with an invalid instruction.
Users are recommended to use an unoptimized miner such as cpuminer-multi.

cpuminer-opt does not work mining Decred algo at Nicehash and produces
only "invalid extranonce2 size" rejects.

Benchmark testing does not work for x11evo.

Bugs
----

Users are encouraged to post their bug reports using git issues or on the
Bitcoin Talk forum or opening an issue in git:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1326803.0

https://github.com/JayDDee/cpuminer-opt/issues

All problem reports must be accompanied by a proper problem definition.
This should include how the problem occurred, the command line and
output from the miner showing the startup messages and any errors.
A history is also useful, ie did it work before.

Donations
---------

cpuminer-opt has no fees of any kind but donations are accepted.
